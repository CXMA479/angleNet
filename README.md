# angleNet
orientationDetection

This is the implementation of my conference paper *Learning Orientation-Estimation Convolutional Neural Network for Building Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Image*
published in [DICTA2018](https://dicta2018.org).
run
```
python train.py
```
for training.

`predict_viz.py` is for prediction.
`config.py` is for configuration.

**Also**
A feature extraction model is needed.
